        <h1>My experience at <a href="shellhacks">Shellhacks</a> 2018</h1>

        <p>As a someone who's learning to be a Software Developer, 
        I have joined a slew of slack channels, and many of their members were talking talking about going ot Shellhacks.
         So, I decided to sign up given the opportunity to network and learn some new hacks. </p>

        <h2>What is Shellhacks</h2> 
        <p>Well, Shellhacks is simply a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon" target="_blank">hackaton</a>, it runs from September 14-16 at FIU in Miami, Fl.The people who came up with the name were debating
        how would a turtles-themed Hackaton should be called. upon brainstorming and since theyâ€™re in Miami, so they decided to
        call it Shellhacks given the city of Miami proximity to the beach and a reference on the computer shells(Geeks). I
        paraphrased all that from their site.</p>
