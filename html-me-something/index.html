        <h1>My experience at <a href="https://shellhacks.net/">Shellhacks</a> 2018</h1>

        <p>As a someone who's learning to be a Software Developer, 
        I have joined a slew of slack channels, and many of their members were talking about going ot Shellhacks.
         So, I decided to sign up given the opportunity to network and learn some new hacks. Although, I could not attend all the workshops, 
         but those I did attend, I enjoyed them thouroughly </p>

        <h2>What is Shellhacks?</h2> 
        <p>Well, Shellhacks is simply a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon" target="_blank">hackathon</a>, it runs from September 14-16 at FIU in Miami, Fl.The people who came up with the name were debating
        how would a turtles-themed Hackaton should be called. upon brainstorming and since theyâ€™re in Miami, so they decided to
        call it Shellhacks given the city of Miami proximity to the beach and a reference on the computer shells(Geeks). I
        paraphrased all that from their site.</p>

            <h2>The events that I attended:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Robotic Process Automation</li>
                <li>Matrix</li>
                <li>Arduino</li>
                <li>Unity</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Robotic Process Automation</h3>
        <p>This is workshop was about how to automate certian process. For exampple, instead of going everyday to pull a report from a database,
            then save it as a csv to import in an excel sheet to create pivot tables and graphs(tedious and time-consuming).
